# About (very briefly)
This is a Unity shooter template built on a little amount of MonoBehaviours. URP (Universal Render Pipeline) is used here.

# Context
This project was my attempt to review classical MonoBehaviour architecture which is very common in Unity projects. 
- Each object has it's own module combinations. That combinations are defined in Scripts/**Realisations**. Common parts are put into base class.
- Behaviour contexts are located in Scripts/**States**
- Behaviours itself are located in Scripts/**Behaviours**
- ModuleSettings folder contains scriptable objects with default settings

The main goal of this project was to reduce code duplicating.
